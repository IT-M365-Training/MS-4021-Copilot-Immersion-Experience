# Immersion Experience - Sales

Gather insights from recent customer interactions, align on key action items, and prepare for an upcoming customer meeting.

You will perform three tasks:
- Gather insights using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**
- Align on action items using **Copilot in Outlook**
- Prepare for a customer meeting using **Copilot in Word**

## Task 1: Gather Insights

Using **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat** (In teams), Gather and review insights from recent interactions with a customer on project implementation. These insights will help you understand customer concerns, progress, and any new opportunities to address during future engagements.

- In **Microsoft Teams**, select **Copilot** at the top of the **Chat** pane.  This will open a **Copilot** window.

**Sample Prompt**:

```text
Summarize my recent interactions with [/Name of Person] regarding [specific customer / topic / project]. Organize the summary by key points or actions discussed, and include any follow-up items or outstanding questions that may require attention.
```

> **NOTE:** Replace [Name of Person] with the person youâ€™re focusing on, and [specific customer / topic / project] with the relevant topic. Use the **/** character (slash) to reference internal contacts for quick access to recent interactions.

## Task 2: Align on Action Items

Using **Copilot in Outlook**, draft a follow-up email based on the insights gathered from Teams Chat. Include open action items, clarify responsibilities, and provide updates to a colleague or team to ensure alignment and accountability.

- In **Outlook**, select **New Email** and then  from the ribbon select **Copilot** > **Draft with Copilot**
