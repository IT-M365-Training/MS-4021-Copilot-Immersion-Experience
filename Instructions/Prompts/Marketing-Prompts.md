### Task 1: Gather customer insights

### Task 2: Develop your positioning strategy  

Using **Copilot in Word**, draft a comprehensive strategy document for brand positioning. Incorporate elements such as an executive summary, target audience, brand messaging, and a competitor analysis, using insights gathered in Task 1.
