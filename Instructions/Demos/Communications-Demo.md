# Communications Demo

**Scenario:**  
You are preparing for an interview with a reporter from a prominent news outlet. Your goal is to gather insights about the reporter, tailor your messaging to their audience, and develop well-crafted answers to potential interview questions. Copilot will assist you throughout this process.

## Demo Setup

There are no sample documents required for this demo.

## Demo Steps

### **Step 1** (Copilot Chat)

Let’s start by using Copilot Chat to research a specific reporter and news outlet on a topic of your choice.

Input the following prompt into Copilot Chat:

```text
I am going to be interviewed by {Reporter / interviewer} from {News outlet} about {Topic}. What are some key things I should know about their previous work and approach to the topic?
```

### **Step 2** (Copilot Chat)

Next, tailor your approach by understanding the news outlet’s audience. Use Copilot to analyze their demographic and interests.

Input the following prompt:

```text
Tell me about {News outlet}'s demographic plus their audience's interests and knowledge level on {Topic}.
```

### **Step 3** (Copilot Chat)

Anticipate the questions the reporter might ask by prompting Copilot.

Input the following prompt:

```text
Generate the top 10 questions that {Reporter / interviewer} might ask in my interview. They should be informed by the research conducted above and crafted to be conversational yet concise.
```

### **Step 4** (Copilot Chat)

Draft answers to the anticipated questions and organize them in a table format. Save the table into a Word document for future use.

Input the following prompt:

```text
Draft answers to the questions in a table format. Save the table with questions and answers into a Word document.
```

### **Step 5** (Word)

1. Open the saved Word document with the Q&A table from Step 4.

1. Click anywhere in the body of the document and select the copilot icon. Type in the following prompt:

    ```text
    Create an FAQ for a technical audience who are new to {Topic}. Include the top 15 questions for publishing on a blog. Leverage the questions and answers from this document.
    ```

1. Review and refine the FAQ. Ensure it:
    - Includes accurate, relevant, and concise answers.
    - Is logically structured for clarity and readability.
