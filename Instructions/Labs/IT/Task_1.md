## **IT: Task 1 - Identify Opportunities for Cybersecurity Enhancements**

### **Steps**

#### **Brainstorm Cybersecurity Strategies**:

1. Open your browser and navigate to [m365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com).

1. Sign in using your Microsoft work account (Copilot license is required).

1. In **Copilot Chat**, ensure **Web mode** is selected, then copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:

    **Sample Prompt**

    ```text
    Can you help me identify weaknesses or gaps in cybersecurity strategies within [specific industry or company type]? I’m looking for insights into emerging threats and innovative solutions to enhance security and resilience.
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[specific industry or company type]` with `healthcare IT systems` or `small businesses`).

1. Copy the output from Copilot Chat to a new Word document and save the file to your OneDrive account with the name **Cybersecurity Insights.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Be sure to save the file to OneDrive rather than your local PC. In the next exercise, you’ll use Copilot in Word to create a presentation based on this document, which must be saved in OneDrive for Copilot to access it.
