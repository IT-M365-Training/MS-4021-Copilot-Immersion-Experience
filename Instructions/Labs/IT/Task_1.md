    Can you help me identify gaps in IT infrastructure or cybersecurity strategies within [specific industry or company type]? I’m looking for underserved areas or emerging trends that could improve system performance, security, or scalability.
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[specific industry or company type]` with `financial services` or `healthcare IT systems`).
