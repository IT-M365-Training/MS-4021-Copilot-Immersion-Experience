    **Sample Prompt**

    ```text
    Can you help me identify gaps in employee engagement strategies within [specific industry or company type]? I’m looking for underserved areas or emerging trends that could improve retention and satisfaction.
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[specific industry or company type]` with `the tech industry` or `remote-first companies`).

1. Copy the output from Copilot Chat to a new Word document and save the file to your OneDrive account with the name **Copilot HR Research.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
