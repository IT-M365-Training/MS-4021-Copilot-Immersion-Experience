    Can you help me identify gaps in corporate communication strategies within [specific industry or company type]? I’m looking for underserved areas or emerging trends that could improve internal communication, employee engagement, or external brand messaging.
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[specific industry or company type]` with `the tech industry` or `nonprofit organizations`).
