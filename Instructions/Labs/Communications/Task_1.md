    Can you help me identify emerging trends in corporate brand messaging within [specific industry or audience type]? I’m looking for innovative approaches to improve engagement and build trust with key audiences.
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[specific industry or audience type]` with `the tech industry` or `millennial audiences`).

1. Copy the output from Copilot Chat to a new Word document and save the file to your OneDrive account with the name **Brand Messaging Trends.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.
