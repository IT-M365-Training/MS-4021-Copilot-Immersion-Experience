#### Steps

- **Brainstorm Ideas**:

    1. Open your browser and navigate to [m365copilot.com](https://m365copilot.com).

    1. Sign in using your Microsoft work account (Copilot license is required).

    1. In **Copilot Chat**, ensure **Web mode** is selected, then copy and paste the sample prompt into the prompt field:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```text
        Can you help me identify gaps in the [specific market or industry] that could be potential opportunities for a new product or company? I’m looking for underserved areas or emerging trends that could be capitalized on.
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice (e.g., replace `[specific market or industry]` with `Artificial Intelligence industry`).

    1. Copy the output from Copilot Chat to a new Word document and save the file to your OneDrive account with the name **Copilot Research.docx**. The next exercise uses this document.
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Be sure to save the file to OneDrive rather than your local PC. In the next exercise, you’ll use Copilot in Word to create a presentation based on this document, which must be saved in OneDrive for Copilot to access it.

- **Conduct Market Research**:

    1. With your company or product idea in mind, use the following prompt to research competitors:

        **Sample Prompt**

        ```text
        I'd like to explore the [industry or market segment] sector. Who are the key competitors?
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > Replace the text within brackets with your specific choice.

    1. Copy the response to the Word document you created earlier.
